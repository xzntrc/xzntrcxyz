        <h2>Transgenderism and its Problems.</h2>
        <p><small>An Elusive, in-depth argument against Transgenderism ~ Austin Eccentrici ; August 25th, 2022. 23:02</small></p> 
        <p>For whatever reason the notion of "transgenderism" is at an all-time high in Western Societies; for example, in the UK, young people referred for "gender treatment" has increased from 97 in 2009 to 2,510 in 2017-2018, an over 4,000 percent increase in 10 years. This alone raises a couple of questions; what is transgenderism? Is it physically possible to change your gender? What has caused this seemingly random increase in popularity?</p>

        <h3>
            What is "transgenderism"?
        </h3>
        <p>Defining transgenderism is extremely difficult without offending anyone, that said I was able to find a definition from <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/transgender">Marriam-Webster</a> - a well known and respected dictionary - defining transgenderism as; "[being] a person whose gender identity differs from the sex the person had or was identified as having at birth". This definition alone is rather confusing; isn't gender and sex the same thing?</p>
        <p>Most of us, being born pre-2010, would've been raised with the simplistic idea that sex and gender is the same thing; male, or female. Transgenderism brings forth an idea that sex and gender are two separate terms which "should not be confused". The idea is that a person's "sex" can either be male or female based on what you are born as based on genitalia (going good so far!). Now, "gender" is described as what someone believes they are (Okay, now- what?), it's okay to be confused at this statement; if you are, it means there is hope for humanity.</p>
        
        <h3>
            How is it possible to change your gender?
        </h3>
        <p>Simply put, it's impossible, now to come to such a conclusion; we must first take a look at basic science; the same sort of science that atheists use to defend their points (I promise to not get religious on this one). To explain briefly, the human body is comprised of many microscopic cells (typically the diameter of these cells are less than a tenth of a human hair), these cells make up everything on our body. Take a look at your "pinky-toe"; while being the smallest toe, it has around 2 - 3 billion cells inside it. The significance of these cells can be examined when you understand what is inside of each of them; Chromosomes, which are tightly packaged "thread-like" structures that form our DNA (think of it as our "genetic code" if you will). </p>
        <p>Each chromosome is the genetic information, or DNA, that is responsible for coding for certain traits. For the human person, there are 23 pairs of chromosomes or 46 total chromosomes. Each of the pairs comes from the parent's DNA, one from the mother and one from the father.
        Looking at each of the 23 pairs of chromosomes, they code for certain body parts, the color of hair and skin, as well as height of the individual. The last pair of chromosomes are known as the <b>sex</b> chromosomes; every man has the same sex chromosomes (X and a Y), and every woman has the same (X and an X). It is crucial that the body knows who it is. For example, whenever your hair grows; it's always the same color, because the cells of your body make it that way; and is scientifically impossible to change. This <b>applies</b> to sex as well. </p>
        <h3>
            The hypocrisy.
        </h3>
        <p>As we've established in the above paragraph; that it is completely impossible for a person to change what they were born as, specifically sex. Now that we've established that there is no possible way that gender and sex can be different, we should examine the hypocrisy that comes along with transgenderism. As previously mentioned, the notion of this separation is all about what you identify as which makes no genuine sense. If it's possible to change your sex based solely on the implication that you are what you aren't then that also implies that it must be possible to change other characteristics about yourself.</p>
        <p>If I claim to be Black, that doesn't change my heritage which was quite literally "set in stone"; does that mean that I am allowed to say usually derogatory comments? I don't think any judge would believe that if you told them it, right before being charged with hate-speech. So if you can't change your race, how can you change your sex, and moreover, how is it legally accepted among the medical world, educational, and legal systems. </p>
        <p>The thought that you are something you aren't is usually classed as a mental illness. In the case of transgenderism, this was the case being called "gender dysphoria" which is now, you guessed it, a derogatory term. If I go around telling people I'm an alien, it doesn't make me an alien and I'll likely be institutionalized.</p>
        <h3>
            What can you do?
        </h3>
        <p>Finally, what can you do in an era where people are believing in the make-believe? I suggest not giving in; don't refer to people by names that reflects their transgender identity (by doing so, it shows you are in acceptance), and always exercise your right to freedom. </p>

        <h3>
            Notes.
        </h3>
        <p>In rare instances, some people can genuinely be born inheriting traits of both male and female; this may include genitalia (i.e, a penis while having breasts). The term for this is "inter-sex" and should not be confused with transgenderism.</p>
        <p>All statements voiced on this have factual evidence to back it up. In the case of any defamation, you may email me from my contact below, however I likely will not read it.</p>
